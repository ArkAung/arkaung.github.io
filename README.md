## Get in touch with me if you are:
* Interested in conducting various experiments for [forward-forward algorithm](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/FFA13.pdf).
  * I am exploring using different overlaying paradigms for positive and negative data when training with FFA.
  * I am exploring hybrid apporaches where we train parts of the network with FFA and other parts with back propagation.
* Interested in self-driving cars, measuring uncertainty in deep neural networks, active learning and knowledge distillation.

### I organize
* [AI Discussions](https://arkaung.github.io/aidiscussions/)
* Independent research group working on a novel active learning technique using knowledge distillation. For more info on this, please send me an email.
